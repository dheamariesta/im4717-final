              <p class="carddesc">
                Dental implants are metal posts or frames that are surgically positioned into the jawbone beneath your gums.
                Once in place, they allow your dentist to mount replacement teeth onto them.
                An advantage of implants is that no adjacent teeth need to be prepared or ground down to hold your new replacement tooth/teeth in place.

                Braces straighten overcrowded or crooked teeth, as well as corrects orthodontic problems like over or underbites, tooth gaps, and incorrect jaw positions.
                Not only does it help your teeth look straighter, maintaining your dental health is also easier.

              <h4 class="card-heading"><b>Teeth Whitening</b></h4>
              <p class="carddesc">
                Tooth whitening lightens teeth and helps to remove stains and discoloration.
                Whitening is among the most popular cosmetic dental procedures because it can greatly improve how your teeth look.
                Most dentists perform tooth whitening.

              <p class="carddesc">
                Both crowns and most bridges are fixed prosthetic devices.
                Unlike removable devices such as dentures, which you can take out and clean daily, crowns and bridges are cemented onto existing teeth or implants, and can only be removed by a dentist.

              <p class="carddesc">
                Preventive dentistry is oral care that involves education, treatment and practice of maintaining your teeth and gums.
                From daily brushing to annual dental cleanings, explains Healthline, these tasks are designed to avoid gum disease, cavities and enamel wear â€“ which often leads to sensitivity.

                The tooth whitening procedure will make your teeth significantly whiter in less than an hour.
                Almost anyone can benefit from this treatment, including individuals with severe food, coffee, tobacco or even tetracycline stains.
                The procedure will not soften or damage protective enamel.
